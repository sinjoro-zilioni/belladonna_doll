This folder contains the sourcecode for a security bot to keep misinformation out of your telegram groups.
It is a modulised python program which utilised the python-telegram-bot library.
Special thanks to @SroSorcxisto for the file_scanner function which is essential for the blocklist.
and also thanks to the python-telegram-bot staff.


NOTE: 
the misinfo list contains a library of websites which are known to propagate hate-speech, misinformation and or psuedo-science

THIS BOT DOES NOT TRACK ANY INDIVIDUAL USERS!! It only takes the telegram ID numbers of the silver key_bearers (people who are trusted admins)
It does however track the groups it's in (takes the groups username and ID) 


features:
*blocks websites known for misinfo/hate speech and gives a bitchy retort to the violator.
*networks groups it resides in with the /groups command.
*able to remove it from groups which you don't approve of helping.
*ability to add or remove admin privilege for people over the bot.
